# Vite + Prettier + ESlint + Jest

Welcome to my Vite template for React 😃. At the moment, I'm still improving the
template over time, adding a few more things that make it easier to develop 🚀.
<br>

## **Here is the list of technologies:**

- Prettier
- ESLint
- Axios
- Jest

---

### **Prettier**

It will help you format your code as you develop. The default file that comes
with the template is to my liking, but you are free to change it to your
own.😎👍🏻

### **ESLint**

ESLint is your helper in your development 🤖. It will help you to avoid possible
bugs in your code. It has an integration with Prettier to avoid conflicting
styles, it will alert you about some things related to accessibility, better
ways of writing and etc... <br>

> If you want to add or disable any rules, feel free.

### **Axios**

It is an "improvement" of the browser's Fetch API. It brings more facilities for
you to handle HTTP requests and much more. I recommend reading the
[Documentation](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).

### **Jest**

A library of automated tests for you to test your components and much more!. I
recommend reading the
[Documentation of Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).
[Documentation of Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/).

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AugustoTI/template-vite-reactJS.git
  cd template-vite-reactJS
  yarn
  yarn start
```

## ATTENTION!

The `versel.json` file and the `public` folder are configuration files for the
Versel and Netlify servers. <br> If you are going to post a project on Netlify,
you can delete the `versel.json` file.<br> If you are hosting on Versel, you can
delete the `public` folder.
